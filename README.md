# SLIC_QtGui

This is an implementation of the famous SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) algorithm for superpixel oversegmentation.

TODO:
+ implement a gpgpu (opencl, cuda) version for faster processing
+ add more algorithms ?


Feel free to download and modify the source code !

Happy coding ^^
